scRNA HNSCC Primary Tumors Analysis 

Data:
	5 primary tumors
		positive and negative for CD44 and ALDH1A1

when merging samples together:
	keep:
		1) genes that are detected in at least 3 cells
		2) cells that contain at least 100 genes

when filtering cells:
	keep cells that:
		1) nCount/nUMI < 50000
		2) nFeature/nGene < 6250
		3) percent of mitocondrial genes < 30% (25%)

normalize by:
	ln((gene counts for each cell / total counts for that cell) * 10000)

get variable features:
	top 2000
	used later for PCA

scale by:
	all genes/features
	mean expression across cells = 0 and variance = 1
	regress nCount/nUMI, nFeature/nGene, percent of mitochondrial genes, cell cycle

pca:
	picked first 32 PCs (explain 90% variance)

batch correction (harmony):
	batch corrected on runs (5 different runs)
	theta = 2 (diversity clustering penalty)
	lambda = 1 (ridge regression penalty)
	sigma = 0.1 (width of soft kmeans clusters)

clustering 
	1) FindNeighbors: make SNN graph (calculate k-nearest neighbors for each cell and use to calculate neighborhood overlap/Jaccard index b/t every cell k param nearest neighbors)
		k = 20
	2) FindClusters: use SNN modularity optimization based clustering algorithm 
		resolution = .8 (number of communities)
